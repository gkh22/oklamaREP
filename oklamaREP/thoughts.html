                    I spend most of my days in quiet desperation. Writing.
                Coding. And watching anime openings. The colorful jubilance
                temporarily blows away the silence.
                </p>
                <p>

                I go days without a phone.
                </p>
                <p>
                Love, loss, and grief have disturbed my comfort zone,
                but some glimmers of hope speak through my words and 
                quiet, untold dreams.
                </p>
                <p>
                While the people around me move on, I reflect on what matters
                most. The lives in which my words can still reach.
                </p>
                <p>
                As I begin my journey, I crave to be a part of
                a cultural impact after these empty 18 years. The Struggles.
                The Success. And most importantly, the Brotherhood. May
                Jen's Brownies continue to feed me as I strive to create. As 
                I pursue my life's calling.
                </p>
                <p>
                There's beauty in ignorance. And always hope for the unknown.
                </p>
                <p>
                Thank you for nothing. I have not prayed for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                See you on the basketball court.
                </p>
